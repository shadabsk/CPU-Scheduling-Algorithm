# Project Title

CPU Scheduling algorithm Implementation in C

## Getting Started

open .c files from appropriate algorithm folders compile it and run. Also image file represents valid set of input tested during the implementation with solved example

### Prerequisites

There is a simple requirement of text editor and gcc compiler

```
i have used Geany IDE version 1.3.1
```
